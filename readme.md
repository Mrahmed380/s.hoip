And much more! Try `!help` to get a full list of available commands

# Installation

This bot is written to run on top of node.js. Please see https://nodejs.org/en/download/

Once you have NodeJS installed, running `npm install` from the bot directory should install all required packages. If this command prints errors, the bot won't work!

## Windows Users
Please note that you must have a working C compiler and Python in your path for
`npm install` to work. The bot has been tested to work on Windows using Visual Studio 2015 Community and Python 2.7, except for `!pullanddeploy`.
